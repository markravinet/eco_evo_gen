Hi, my MSc research aims to describe the ecological and evolutionary features of microbial communities (prokaryotes, microeukaryotes, and viruses) present in Neotropical bats of Colombia. This project encompasses molecular and bioinformatics techniques to describe the ecological components of several microorganisms and understand their association with emerging diseases. As a master's student, I have worked in the areas of genomics and metagenomics, mainly on microorganisms, to understand the genetic, ecological, and evolutionary features in different biological scenarios. Currently, I am working with house sparrows to study their population structure using genomic analysis.
