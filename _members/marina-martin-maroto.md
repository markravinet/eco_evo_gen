Hello! My academic journey began with an Integrated Masters degree in Biology at the University of York. During this time, I conducted research on latitudinal patterns in birdsong complexity using the XenoCanto database to analyse acoustic features of birdsong recordings. Following my studies, I gained experience working at Kew Gardens as part of the Digital Revolution project working with their collections data. Migrating back to birds, my current PhD research at Nottingham focuses on identifying convergence in ecological, morphological, and genetic adaptation in urban environments across multiple bird species. By combining existing data sources, such as eBird and AVONET, with new field data, I aim to shed light on why some birds thrive in urban settings while others do not.
