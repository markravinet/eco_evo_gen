I am an evolutionary biologist investigating how environmental and ecological change driven by human activity shapes speciation, adaptation, behaviour and evolution. I have worked on a wide variety of organisms including sticklebacks and *Littorina* marine snails but most recently my attention has turned to *Passer* sparrows. I want to understand how adaptation to an anthropogenic niche evolves and what consequences this has for the life history, morphology and behaviour of a species. To achieve this my research harnesses large open-source ecological datasets, incorporates genomics, stable isotope ecology, phenotypic data and behavioural ecology.
