Sarav√°! I have been working in the vein of *Avian Evolutionary Genomics* since my MSc and PhD at the University of Copenhagen, where I started to study the pigeon fancy breeds and the ubiquitous feral pigeon. I also played an important role in the B10K Project that generated and is still generating reference genomes for several avian species. As a postdoctoral researcher of the Sparrow Group, I am chiefly investigating the population dynamics of the Tree Sparrow as well as the recent evolutionary history of the House Sparrow. Besides these projects, I am also involved in other projects concerning the evolution within the *Passer* genus.
