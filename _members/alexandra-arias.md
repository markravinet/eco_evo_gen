I am a Colombian biologist interested in genetics and evolution, particularly focused on understanding the origin and diversification of species through population genomics. I am also passionate about studying the genomic basis of coloration patterns in Neotropical frogs and butterflies. Currently, I am a master's student researching the adaptive radiation of the South American butterfly Heliconius cydno from a genomic and demographic perspective.
