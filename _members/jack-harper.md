 Hi! My PhD research at the University of Nottingham aims to understand the genomic processes behind the survival success of introduced species using the house sparrow as a model. This is being investigated using 3 main objectives. First, reconstructing the global house sparrow spread to identify source populations and evolutionary lineages. Second, analysing a parallel latitudinal cline of populations, in the US and Australia, to determine potential adaptation to a wide range of environments. Lastly, using museum genomics to understand how the genome of introduced populations have changed over time. My research interests broadly include the use of genomics for informing conservation programmes of at-risk species, and also for advising the management of invasive species.
