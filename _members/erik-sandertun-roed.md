I am a PhD student in Mark Ravinet´s Ecological and Evolutionary Genetics group at CEES. My research will investigate the evolutionary adaptation of house sparrows to anthropogenic factors, primarily by analyzing large genomic and ecological datasets. Generally, I am interested in the application of data analysis and simulation to the study of population genetics, genomics, and evolution.

Before joining CEES, I studied genetics and zoology at The University of Queensland and genomics at The Norwegian University of Life Sciences. In my time at UQ I was primarily involved in theoretical work on host-parasite evolution, and while at NMBU I worked on applied molecular ecology in lobsters.
