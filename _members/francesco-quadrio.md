Hi! I have always been fascinated by nature and the processes that shape it. This interest has guided my academic journey, leading me to graduate in biotechnology from the University of Milan Bicocca in 2022 and, subsequently, to enroll in a master's degree program in environmental sciences.
Currently, I am conducting my MSc thesis research at the Center for Ecological and Evolutionary Synthesis in Oslo. Here, I am studying how organisms evolve under the selective pressures of man-made stressors such as pollution. My research interests are particularly focused on Australian populations of house sparrows and the mechanisms underlying their adaptation to heavy metal contamination in their habitat.
By analyzing their genomes, my aim is to understand how these organisms have become able to thrive in these challenging environments, but I also, more broadly, hope to gain insights into the nature of evolutionary processes in general.
